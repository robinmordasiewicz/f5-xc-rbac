# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary
The sync feature imports a CSV of user->group mappings and makes the CSV authoritative for group and membership state. The implementation will:

- Ensure groups referenced in the CSV exist (create if missing).
- Ensure users referenced in the CSV exist (create with minimal attributes if missing).
- Ensure membership assignments from CSV are applied idempotently (add missing memberships, skip existing ones).
- Respect `--dry-run` (log planned actions only) and produce a failure report for rows that could not be processed.

This plan produces Phase 0 research, a data model, API contracts (minimal), and a quickstart for operators.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 (project targets Python 3.12 in docs; implement on 3.11+ compatible)
**Primary Dependencies**: requests, click, pydantic (optional for validation), tenacity (already used), ldap3 (already used for DN parsing)
**Storage**: None persistent — operations performed against the remote XC API; transient local state in memory and failure reports written to disk (CSV or JSON)
**Testing**: pytest (existing tests), click.testing for CLI; unit tests for GroupSyncService and integration-like dry-run tests
**Target Platform**: macOS/Linux environments where CLI is run; CI runs in Linux (GitHub Actions)
**Project Type**: CLI service library (Python package in `src/`)
**Performance Goals**: Handle CSVs up to tens of thousands of rows; implement batching and rate-limiting for very large imports (deferred to Phase 2)
**Constraints**: External API rate limits and private dependencies (some packages may not be resolvable by pip-audit)
**Scale/Scope**: Initial goal: safely process CSV files up to 50k rows with retries; for larger scale, introduce chunking/batching in Phase 2

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above]

Selected structure: keep the existing project layout under `src/xc_rbac_sync` and add feature docs under `specs/056-csv-sync-impl/`. Implementation changes will live in `src/xc_rbac_sync/sync_service.py` (extend GroupSyncService) and `src/xc_rbac_sync/cli.py` (add user creation flags/options and reporting). Tests will be added under `tests/` with unit tests for user creation and membership flows.

Generated artifacts for Phase 0/1 (created):

- `specs/056-csv-sync-impl/research.md`
- `specs/056-csv-sync-impl/data-model.md`
- `specs/056-csv-sync-impl/quickstart.md`
- `specs/056-csv-sync-impl/contracts/openapi.yaml`
